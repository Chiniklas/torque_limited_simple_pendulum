# Simple pendulum swingUp simulation results using optimal control based on the FDDP algorithm:


* statAndTorque file presents the state: (x0) is the joint rotation and (x1) is the joint velocity, and the control (u0) which represents the applied joint torque.


* convergencesDDP file presents the optimization parameters at each iteration.
