# Results of the Simple pendulum swingUp tested on the hardware system, using optimal control based on the FDDP algorithm with limited torque control:



* swingup_pos file presents the joint rotation from the controller (the desired) and the executed (the measured).


* swingup_vel file presents the joint velocity from the controller (the desired) and the executed (the measured).


* swingup_tau file presents the control which represents the applied joint torque from the controller (the desired) and the executed (the measured).


* data_desired file presents the formated data from the solver to control the hardware system.


* data_measured file presents the data extracted from the execution on the hardware system of a swingUp.
